## Machine Learning for Credit Scoring

This project is a part of coursework of Data Mining from University of Southampton

A project to create data mining model which helps to determine if a customer will be delinquent in upcoming 2 years after 90 days past.

List of models used in analysis (classification):
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Extreme Gradient Boosting (Best Performance)
- k-nearest neighbors

### Content
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Clearance
3. Building and Selecting the Model
4. Performance of Model

Project mainly used scikit-learn libraries including given suggestion how to improve credit scoring model. 
Additionally, using cross validation to determine more accurate score which is roc_auc as a final accuracy measure.
Given graph represents that model has potentiality to be good:
